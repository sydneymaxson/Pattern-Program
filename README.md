# Pattern-Program

This program will need to use dialog boxes for input and output.

The program will ask the user for a positive starting value
  if the value isn't positive, then ask again for a positive starting value
  
The program will ask users if they want to see the sequence of numbers

Once those questions are answered the program will start the following pattern

  If the number is odd:  Multiply the number by 3 and add 1
  If the number is even:  Divide the number by 2
  
  Continue this pattern until you get to 1 then stop
  
Once you have stopped output the sequence of numbers if the user answered yes then output the number of terms in the sequence
